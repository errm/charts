To access Kubeslate

1. First start the kubectl proxy:

   kubectl proxy

2. Now open the following URL in your browser:

   http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/{{ .Release.Namespace }}/services/{{ template "kubeslate.fullname" . }}:http/proxy

Please try reloading the page if you see "ServiceUnavailable / no endpoints available for service", as pod creation might take a few moments.
